**EpicureanExplorer: The Recipe App for Everyone!**

Are you tired of recipe apps that give you recipes loaded with the ONE ingredient (tomatoes, anchovies, whatever) you hate?

Are you done with recipe apps that just fetch content from an API and give you whatever recipe shows up, even if it's loaded with sugar, carbs, or saturated fat?

Well, today's your lucky day! As someone who's passionate about cooking, food, and fitness, I started this app in order to generate specialized recipes according to users' specific plans (gain muscle, lose weight, etc) that are still tasty and sophisticated!

TECH USED:
- Python
- MongoDB

NEW PROJECT IDEA:
* Recipe Book:
   * Develop a recipe book where users can browse, search, and save their favorite recipes.
   * Use the MongoDB database to store the saved recipes.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

### 1. **Introduction**
   - **Purpose:** 
      The document is meant to be a comprehensive overview of the project requirements. The project itself is a recipe app that incorporates
      fitness by generating tasty and elegant recipes that fit into users' workout and weight loss plans. The project should also filter by ingredients so that users don't need to endure food they hate to get healthy.
   - **Scope:** 
      The project will be a Flask application - HTML/CSS front-end, Flask backend, MongoDB database. Flask is a Python web-dev framework. In future updates, we may make a React front-end, but for now, we'll stick with HTML/CSS. The project will query the Spoonacular API for recipe content, which it will then store in a MongoDB database. Then, the project will have a mechanism to get user input (e.g. does the user want more protein, more veggies, portion control, etc), which it will use to query the database to get the recipes best suited for the user's needs.
   - **Background:** 
      As important as weight loss plans and apps are, they're known for being overly restrictive and/or sacrificing flavor for health. It
      can also be difficult for picky eaters to gain motivation to eat healthy, speaking from experience, as sometimes the very foods they
      dislike are front-and-center in many diet plans. So I'm working on this app, so that hopefully people with my kind of "picky eater"
      palates who are passionate about fitness can fix their diets without sacrificing cool recipes or flavors. 

### 2. **Functional Requirements**
   - **Use Cases:** Describe various interactions with the system.
   - **Functional Specifications:** Detail specific functionalities the app must have.
   - **Data Handling:** Define how data will be stored, retrieved, and manipulated.

### 3. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - **Performance:** Specify response times, throughput, etc.
   - **Usability:** Define user interface requirements.
   - **Security:** Outline security measures and protocols.
   - **Scalability:** Discuss how the app will handle growth.

### 4. **Constraints**
   - **Technical Constraints:** Hardware, software, and platform limitations.
   - **Regulatory:** Compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.
   - **Resource Constraints:** Limitations in budget, time, or expertise.

### 5. **Assumptions and Dependencies**
   - **Assumptions:** Things presumed true but not confirmed.
   - **Dependencies:** External factors affecting the project.

### 6. **Risks**
   - **Identification:** List potential risks that might impact the project.
   - **Mitigation Plan:** Strategies to address and mitigate these risks.

### 7. **Sign-off**
   - **Approval:** Space for stakeholders to approve the requirements document.
