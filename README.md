**EpicureanExplorer: The Recipe App for Everyone!**

Are you tired of recipe apps that give you recipes loaded with the ONE ingredient (tomatoes, anchovies, whatever) you hate?

Are you done with recipe apps that just fetch content from an API and give you whatever recipe shows up, even if it's loaded with sugar, carbs, or saturated fat?

Well, today's your lucky day! As someone who's passionate about cooking, food, and fitness, I started this app in order to generate specialized recipes according to users' specific plans (gain muscle, lose weight, etc).

TECH USED:
- Python
- SQL
